The aim of this project was to see which kind of classifier has better accuracy.
I used a simple Naive Bayes Algorithm, an SVM, and a DNN for this. All the models are 
coded using the sklearn library, and the code is provided in the appendix. As a dataset,
I used a toy dataset from Scikit Learn, specifically the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset.
This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. The dataset provides 569 instances
with 30 features each. Each instance is classified as benign(1) or malignant(0). More information about this
dataset is available at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html.
